# 2D-Dungeon
My first, big Unity 2D project. Still WiP in the early stage.
"2D Dungeon" will evolve into a fantasy platformer game with a fierce warrior-princess as a protagonist.
Classic pixel-art graphics + sounds assets are downloaded from official Unity Asset Store (free!).

I am aware this code needs refactoring, will be split into multiple scripts.

Implemented (introduction level):
* player movement
* jumping
* basic animations
* sound

To be added (with additional levels):
* UI, main menu
* opening doors, trapdoors
* simple HP system
* objects, which can hurt the player
* moving/disappearing platforms
* simple enemies and combat system
